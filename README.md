# LSTM-Sine
Practice LSTMs with Pytorch. This LSTM learns 20 sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. 
The hyperparameters aren't optimized yet, so it overfits.
The [results](https://github.com/n3iii0/LSTM-Sine/blob/master/Prediction.png) can be seen below.
The orange line shows the given input data. The blue line shows the prediction based on the input.
